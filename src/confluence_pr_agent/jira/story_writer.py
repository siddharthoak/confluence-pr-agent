"""Writes the Jira story's title/description/acceptance-criteria (and,
optionally, a complexity suggestion) from the Confluence spec diff -- before
any code exists, so this only ever sees the spec, not the eventual change.

Prefers JUDGE_PROVIDER/JUDGE_MODEL (config.py) over a separate provider
setting -- it's the same kind of thing, a single structured-output call to
whichever LLM is already configured, not an agentic session. But the LLM
Judge is optional and often left unconfigured (or configured with a key
that turns out not to work), which would otherwise silently leave every
story on the plain-text fallback -- so if GEMINI_API_KEY is set, it's tried
next, independent of JUDGE_PROVIDER: CHANGE_AGENT_ENGINE=gemini already
requires that key to be live for the pipeline to do anything at all, making
it the one path here that doesn't depend on the judge setup being right too.
