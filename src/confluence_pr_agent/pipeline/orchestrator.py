"""Orchestrates the full pipeline:

Confluence page changed -> diff vs. last-seen version -> clone target repo ->
a pluggable change engine implements the change + tests -> run tests locally
(gate, with a bounded self-correction retry loop) -> an LLM judge reviews
the diff (never blocks -- only changes what kind of PR opens) -> commit/push
/open PR -> email the team.

Which change engine actually writes the code (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub
Copilot, ...) is a config choice (CHANGE_AGENT_ENGINE), not something this
module knows about -- see agent/base.py and agent/factory.py. Same for which
model reviews it (JUDGE_PROVIDER) -- see judge/base.py and judge/factory.py.

The only two things that stop a PR from opening at all are: the change
engine failing outright / making no changes, and the test suite still
failing after every retry attempt. The LLM judge is advisory, not a gate --
a "rejected" verdict still opens a PR, just as a draft flagged "[Needs
Work]" with its rubric attached, instead of silently doing nothing. This is
deliberate: the pipeline runs unattended (webhook-triggered), so there is no
one present to act on a pipeline-internal "are you sure?" -- the one place a
human reviews this system's output is at PR merge time, which this design
preserves and feeds with more information instead.

The page-version store is only updated once a PR has actually opened
(including a judge-rejected draft), so a run that produced no durable
artifact at all (agent failure, tests still failing after retries, PR API
error) is retried from the same diff on the next webhook delivery / manual
re-trigger rather than being silently marked as processed.
