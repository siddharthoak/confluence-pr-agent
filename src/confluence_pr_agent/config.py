"""Configuration, in two tiers.

`ProcessConfig` is read once at import from the real process environment /
the container's own top-level `.env` -- DATA_DIR (base directory), LOG_LEVEL,
INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET (checked against the header Caddy forwards after
Basic Auth -- see ui/routes.py::current_username and Caddyfile.example),
DEFAULT_USER (the single-tenant bootstrap identity `/webhook/confluence`
resolves to, and a local `uvicorn --reload` dev fallback when there's no
Caddy in front to forward a real identity). Everything here is genuinely
process-wide; there's only one running server.

`Settings` is everything else (Confluence, repo, change engine, judge,
Jira, email, polling) -- one instance PER AUTHENTICATED USER (see
get_settings below), loaded from that user's own
`data/users/<username>/.env` and nothing else. `Settings` deliberately
never reads os.environ at all (see settings_customise_sources) -- with
N users' Settings potentially constructed in the same process, falling
back to process-wide os.environ would silently leak one user's values into
another's. This is the same bug class this project hit once already (a
real .env value leaked into pytest's Settings() construction mid-session,
silently breaking unrelated tests) before being isolated at the test level
with monkeypatch.delenv; excluding the env source at the model level fixes
it permanently for every caller, not just tests.
